# React Course Project One
A `create-react-app` to serve as the section 8 project in the [academind react-complete-guide-code](https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code)

### To Get Started 
Clone this repo onto your machine. Scripts are the same as those that come out of the box with `create react app` to so start...
`$ npm run start`. We may expand these scripts to include environments. 

### Collaborating 
The goal here is to continuously develop source control skills in collaboration. To any collaborators, please create a new feature branch for any new feature you've created and submit a pull request for that code to be reviewed. Code review is really important and really powerful. ðŸ”¥

### Specs
While there doesn't seem to be a project plan from the course instructors I've gathered this much...
- **./components/ui**
    - error overlay component
    - reusable button 
- **./components/user**
    - a component to enter name and age (AddUser.js)
    - list of users
